# Introduction
We propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO), that can automatically induce different undefined classes from the other class to improve few-shot NER. With these extra-labeled undefined classes, our method will improve the discriminative ability of NER classifier and enhance the understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge. 

Our academic paper which describes MUCO in detail can be found here: https://tongmeihan1995.github.io/meihan.github.io/research/ACL2021.pdf.
